Twitter's Cache Use Cases
*************************

Here we assemble a list of typical and important cache use cases at Twitter.
The goal is to offer some context on how people are using cache, so we can
provide continuous support and development to improve these use cases. The
entries here should be viewed as important categories instead of an exhaustive
list.


Flat Values
===========

Simple Blobs
------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

A simple key whose value is a binary "blob". This works for cases where the
value is almost always used as a whole, such as a string, or is small enough
that retrieval overhead is low. This is the oldest data model of key-value
caching.


Examples
^^^^^^^^

* gizmoduck (user service) caches user object in cache
* talon (t.co URL service) caches shortened URL that points to original URL


Simple Counts
-------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

A simple key whose value is a number (currently an integer due to implementation
constraints in most backends). These can be backed by persistent store, or not.
Noteworthy API usage includes `incr` and `decr`. Since `incr/decr` are not
idempotent, the counts can be slightly off compared to the true value. But it is
often good enough when exact value doesn't matter too much.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

* limiter service uses cache for per-source or per-endpoint rate limiting. Not
  backed by DB.
* tweetypie (tweet service) stores reply/fav/RT as simple counts. Backed by DB.


Structured Values
=================

Attribute Sets
--------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
A primary key whose value is a record, i.e. a collection of attributes. Most
data objects Twitter deals with are reasonably rich, e.g. user objects and
tweet objects, but it may not always be worthwhile to treat them as such in the
cache backend. Whether they fit better into the unstructured or structured key
schema depending on (at least) the following factors:

#. size of the object value: keys with a few attributes and small values can
   often be more efficiently packed as a simple string as compared to structured
   keys, object with a lot of attributes often can be updated more efficiently
   with structured keys.
#. extensibility of the attribute fields (variability): if a lot of the
   attributes are optional, it is easier to query a small subset of them with
   structured keys
#. access pattern: if all attributes are always used together (e.g. tweet
   hydration), structured keys don't provide much value


Timelines
---------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

Indices of content. Most of Twitter's public content is organized this way. For
example, a user timeline which contains all tweet IDs created by a particular
user and sorted in reverse chronological order is the building block of many
other views, such as home timeline. The timeline entries are often homogeneous
and tiny- integers or other unique identifier types. The natural data structure
for this use case is sorted set or list, with flexible sorting criteria for
timelines of different nature (by timestamp, by local key, by weight/tag...).
Updates are almost always incremental and small, but account for the majority of
steady-state throughput due to fanout. This use case really benefits from data
structure support, as read-modify-write greatly increases bandwidth consumption
and write contention. Updates mostly happen at one end of the timeline- fanout
appends to the newest end, and truncation happens on the oldest end; insertion
and deletion at arbitrary location are relatively infrequent.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
* timeline service which has over a dozen timelines of different nature, almost
  all cached

Time series
-----------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Compared to timelines, time series have values associated with each entry in the
sequence, instead of the entry being the only content that matters. Most of
observability metrics fit into this type, where the metric name remains the same
over a long period of time and series is made up of values gathered at different
timestamps. Most of analytical data processed via streaming compute pipelines
also fit. The natural data structure for this type is also sorted set, and
almost always sorted by local key. The update pattern and read/write ratio
appear very similar to timeline, but the update operation often involves
arithmetic operations such as `incr/decr`. So this is equivalent to a simple
counter use case but with structured keys.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

* metrics and values which are recorded periodically
* data analytics maintains per-time-window tweet impression and engagement counts
  for target
